Instructions:
To run this code, you must choose choices, whether it is a number or capitalized letter in order to follow along
with the story of The Symphony of Lost Souls. My story is about you and your time trying to not only find 
'The Soul Harp' but also going into the Mistwood Forest in order to find balance in between your realm and some place other worldly.
With these instructions I leave you to enjoy the story I made.

Final Statement:

Our team completed this project with code that we wrote ourselves. 
Any time we used code from a source outside the resources for this class, it was only a few lines and we cited 
that source in the code. - Isabel Kyle
